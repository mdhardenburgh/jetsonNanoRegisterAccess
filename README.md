# jetsonNanoRegisterAccess
Jetson Nano direct hardware register access.

## Introduction
This is a library for accessing peripherals to the ARM A57 core. There are two
methods of doing this.

1. The first method is using the file system method (/sys/class/gpio). This 
   method isn't fast, and not the focus of this repository but, I will link 
   sources to it because it is fairly uncomplicated and could be usefull to
   someone in the future. The following links are regarding this method:
   * [Gpio pin access in C++](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/using-gpio-pins-with-c-on-the-nano/75783)  
   * [Github repo for accessing GPIOs using the file system method](https://github.com/pjueon/JetsonGPIO)
   * [Mod answer about the gpio file system method](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/how-to-use-gpio-in-c-language/75191)
   * [More example code on how to use the file system method](https://www.ics.com/blog/how-control-gpio-hardware-c-or-c)
   * [Setting PWM hardware using file systme method and uboot pinmux](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/nano-pwm-c/122492/9)

2. The second method is via the directly accessing the registers. This method
   is faster because it skips the file system access overhead, but is much
   more involved. This method is the primary focus of this repository. The
   following are links which I deemed useful in this endevor:

## Building Examples
To build the examples you need the [Jetson Nano GCC](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/linux-tegra-r3271) 
and [CMake version 3.23.1 or later](https://cmake.org/download/). This script 
assumes that the jetson nano gcc folder is called `gcc-linaro-7.3.1-2018.05-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu`
and is located in the home directory.

To source the enviroment the run:

`$ source jetsonNanoEnv`

A successful output looks like:

`JETSON_GCC_LOCATION is /home/matthew/jetsonNanoBsp/gcc-linaro-7.3.1-2018.05-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu`

To run cmake:

`$ <cmake_location>/bin/cmake .`

Where <cmake_location> is the location of your cmake folder. For example, my
cmake folder is in the home directory so my command will look like:

`$ ~/cmake-3.23.1-linux-x86_64/bin/cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=jetsonToolChain.cmake .`

This command will create the makefiles for all of the examples.

To build, in the root directory run:

`$ make all`
